What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works : Round-Robin algorithm is works on distributing the request on multiple webserver 
in sequential cycle order , for example if we have 3 servers it will go like 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both :active-Passive setup:
until something happen to the active one to take over.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works : primary database is the main source of data and can accept insert,update,delte operation when 
replica database (slave) is a copy of primary and it's read-only database.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application :
Replica node is a copy of primary node and each change happen to the primary node will aply to the replica node 
but you can't make any change on replica node directly
so if something happed to primary node the replica node will take over is like a back up.
